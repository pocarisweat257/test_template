## Introduction


Recent vehicles are making efforts to adopt Zonal Architecture rather than the conventional ECU placement that centers on functionalities. In this context, secure isolation between different system domains is essential for a single controller to meet diverse safety requirements of multiple systems. To achive this, there have been continuous efforts to introduce hypervisor technology -originally used in servers- into vehicles, aiming to accomplish safe data transfer between different domains while miniimizing performance degradation.
This project aims to intergrate the Head Unit Qt application and the PDC-System into a Mixed Criticality System. Both systems, developed in the previous project, will be separated into different domains on a single RPi using a hypervisor, and exchanged data through interdomain communication.
